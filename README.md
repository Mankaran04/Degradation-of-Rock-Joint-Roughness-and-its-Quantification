# Degradation-of-Rock-Joint-Roughness-and-its-Quantification
Studied degradation of rock joint roughness using photogrammetry-based 3D surface modeling and direct shear testing on Plaster of Paris (POP) joint samples.
Estimated roughness parameters (Z₂) and Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) before and after shearing using empirical correlations.
Analysed the relationship between asperity damage, shear strength reduction, and dilation behavior under controlled normal stress.
