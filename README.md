**#Degradation of Rock Joint Roughness and its Quantification**
Studied degradation of rock joint roughness using photogrammetry-based 3D surface modeling and direct shear testing on Plaster of Paris (POP) joint samples.
Estimated roughness parameter (Z₂) and Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) before and after shearing using empirical correlations.
Analysed the relationship between asperity damage, shear strength reduction, and dilation behaviour under controlled normal stress.
